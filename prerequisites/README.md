# PyTorch Zero to Hero: The Foundations

Welcome to the start of your deep learning journey! This repository is designed to take you from a complete beginner to building complex neural networks, one step at a time.

We believe in **learning by doing**, so every chapter is a self-contained Jupyter notebook that introduces one core concept without overwhelming you.

## Currently Released Chapters

We are releasing this course progressively. Here are the first two "atoms" of the deep learning universe:

### [Chapter 1: The Magic of Tensors](./01_Tensors.ipynb)
Every piece of data in AI—images, text, audio—is just a list of numbers. In PyTorch, these are called **Tensors**.
*   **What you'll learn:** How to create, manipulate, and move tensors to the GPU for blazing fast math.
*   **Analogy:** Think of them as NumPy arrays with superpowers.

### [Chapter 2: Autograd - The Engine of Learning](./02_Autograd.ipynb)
How do machines "learn"? They use calculus to find the best settings. But don't worry, you don't need to do the math!
*   **What you'll learn:** How PyTorch's `autograd` engine automatically calculates gradients (derivatives) for you.
*   **Analogy:** A magical assistant that follows you around and records every math operation you do, so it can replay it backwards later.


### [Chapter 3: Your First Model](./03_Linear_Regression.ipynb) 📉
We'll build a linear regression model from scratch to predict patterns in data.
*   **What you'll learn:** How to define a model, loss function, and optimizer to fit a line to noisy data.
*   **Analogy:** Teaching a machine to find the "best fit" trend line, just like you would in Excel but with calculus.

---

### [Chapter 4: Neural Networks & Non-Linearity](./04_Neural_Networks.ipynb) 🧠
Linear lines are boring. We'll add "activation functions" to build real Neural Networks (MLPs) that can solve complex problems.
*   **What you'll learn:** How to stack linear layers with ReLU activation to learn curved functions.
*   **Analogy:** Building a brain that can "bend" its thinking to fit complex patterns.

---

### [Chapter 5: The Training Loop](./05_Training_Loop.ipynb) 🔄
We'll master the standard 5-step recipe used to train almost every deep learning model in existence.
*   **What you'll learn:** How to structure training/validation loops, monitor loss curves, and avoid common pitfalls.
*   **Analogy:** Turning your messy experimentation code into a professional, reusable training framework.

---

## Coming Soon...

We have a full roadmap ahead! Stay tuned for the upcoming chapters where we will put these atoms together to build intelligent systems:
*   **Chapter 6: Handling Real Data** 
    *   How to feed thousands of images into your model efficiently using `Datasets` and `DataLoaders`.
*   **Chapter 7: Computer Vision (CNNs)** 
    *   We'll teach computers how to "see" using Convolutional Neural Networks.

STAY TUNED!
